### Hi, I am Sina
  
I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/), working in the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning).
  
My research aims to leverage deep learning techniques, particularly graph neural networks, to integrate multimodal health data that help design an accurate life-threatening disease diagnostic system. Moreover, I am developing methods to reduce the dimensionality of large-scale data through feature selection.
