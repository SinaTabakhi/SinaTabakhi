### Hi, I am Sina
  
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/), working in the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning).
  
I am currently investigating the efficient feature selection methods for integrative multi-omics analysis that help design an accurate life-threatening disease diagnostic system.
